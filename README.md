# 🛡️ Aegis Programming Language

**Aegis** is a visionary, all-in-one programming language designed for the future of:
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity**
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence**
- 🌐 **Web & App Development**
- 🧮 **Scientific Computing**
- 🧰 **Systems & Embedded Programming**

Aegis brings together the best features of Python, C/C++, Rust, Java, Go, JavaScript, and more — all under one clean, secure, and powerful programming model.

> _“Under the shield of Aegis, no idea is too bold.”_

## 🚀 Vision

To create the **most complete, secure, and high-performance** programming language — combining the **readability of Python**, **performance of C/C++**, **safety of Rust**, **tooling of JS**, and **modularity of Go** — built for developers who want **deep control**, **rich abstractions**, and **modern power**.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

| Principle             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **All-in-One Power**  | A language for DSA, ML, compilers, UIs, and OS kernels. |
| **Readable Yet Powerful** | Pythonic syntax with C-level performance. |
| **DSA-Native**        | Graphs, Trees, Queues, Stacks, Heaps — **language-level keywords**. |
| **OOP First-Class**   | Classes, interfaces, traits, polymorphism — **no compromise**. |
| **Hybrid Typing**     | Dynamic when needed, static when critical — with type inference. |
| **Memory Smart**      | Managed by default, with optional manual memory control. |
| **Secure by Design**  | Built-in sandboxing, crypto, permission safety. |
| **Visual Debugging**  | Auto-generated control flow & AST diagrams. |
| **STL-Inspired**      | Algorithms like sort, search, traversal via `aegistl`. |

## 📦 Language Features (Planned)

- ✅ Pythonic indentation & syntax
- ✅ Functional & OOP paradigms
- ✅ Native data structures: `tree`, `graph`, `queue`, `stack`, etc.
- ✅ Keyword-based algorithms: `sort`, `search`, `dfs`, `bfs`, `dp`, `recursion`
- ✅ Hybrid dynamic + static typing
- ✅ Traits, interfaces, inheritance
- ✅ Manual & auto memory management
- ✅ Pattern matching and destructuring
- ✅ Native `await`, `spawn`, `channel` for concurrency
- ✅ Standard library with STL-like tools
- ✅ Built-in crypto tools: `sha256()`, `aes_encrypt()`
- ✅ Visual flowchart output
- ✅ Pluggable C/C++/Rust modules
